# üí´ About Me:
Hey! I am Fanindra, an aspiring Product (UX/UI) Designer, a final-year computer science student passionate about handcrafting seamless digital experiences. I enjoy exploring and always want to learn and take on new challenges. My time as a UX Design Intern at Pulpit Mobility helped me get better at what I do.<br><br>Beyond design, I spend most of my time either watching cricket or exploring my hobbies in architecture, interior design and photography. I'm all ears for discussions on MCU, food, cricket, keyboards, tech, and maps. Let's spark up some engaging talks!
